## About me

Hi there!

My name is Para Yong, Yong for short.

I am originally from province AnHui but in 2017 I made one of the biggest decisions in my life and came to ShangHai to join a brand new commpany named TongChen Financial bussiness.

Being so far from home was not easy to begin with but life in here has turned out to be better than I could ever have imagined when I made that decision.

I am currently living and working in ShangHai,CN.

### Software Engineer

I work on software department to development and solve problems in our financial bussiness. In my role, I code mainly in JavaScript but I often use Node, Java and PHP as well.

### Wannabe Freestyle Footballer

I keep a football in my office and practice at lunch time. My current favourite place to practice is the alley at the back of my office off which there are several pubs. The surface is uneven and made of cobbles but I like it there because it is very quiet at lunch time.
